* It appears that some versions of glibc (at least the one used by debian sarge) have a memory leak
  in their iconv_close. As the misc::Scalar class in the libocfamisc library makes heavy use of
  iconv calls, this issue results in a MAJOR MEMORY LEAK on systems that use such versions of
  glibc. To be absolutely precise, for any 'scalar' read by a process from an xml file (these xml
  files are used to comunicate metadata between processes and are thus very numerous), each
  such action would leak 12 bytes of memory. Unless you plan to use the open computer forensics
  architecture on less than a few GB of data it is strongly sugested to AVOID the usage of
  systems that are affected by this bug in glibc.

* log4clogger uses non exception safe mutex constructs. This might result in deadlocks when the logger 
  throws an exception. The sysloglogger does not have this problem.
