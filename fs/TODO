* The source code from sleuthkit could be used to implement a SleuthkitFilesystem loadable module.
  See TSK.TODO for more info.

* The implementation of the NTFSConnectedNode is currently still broken and unfinished. But as this code is only used
  when a module is run as root, the current lib is functional al long as kickstarting is not yet done as root.
* The NTFSFilesystem should extend the functionality of the Sleuthkit stuff by giving access to alternate streams.

* AlternateStreams suport for hfs filesystems.

* If the combination of sleuthkit based modules with commercialy build modules is a problem, than the alternative
  modules for the sleuthkit supported filesystems is required. 

* Comultative sizes and allocation as metadata for directories and filesystems.

* Filesystem size.
