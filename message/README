In order to build libocfamessage you should
===========================================

1. install ACE
2. install boost

ACE is used for the Reactor framework and IPC.
Boost is used for the serialization of messages.

Both packages are a pain to install, so enjoy :)


Boost make:
===========

Boost uses something called a .jam file. Jam itself
is also part of the distribution so you have to
build that first, using 'make'. After that you use
jam to build boost.

sudo rpm -i boost-jam-3.1.11-1.i386.rpm
or
tar zxvf boost-jam-3.1.11.tgz
cd boost-jam-3.1.11
./build.sh

cd <to your boost main dir>
sudo bjam "-sTOOLS=gcc" install

ACE make (using ace 5.4.4):
=========

For ACE you have to set the ACE_ROOT environment variable
to point to <some path on your system>/ACE/ACE_wrappers.
Eg.: export ACE_ROOT=/home/xxxx/ACE_wrappers

Also make a symlink from
$ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h -> config-linux.h
Eg.: cd $ACE_ROOT/ace
     ln -s config-linux.h config.h
     

and 

$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU -> platform_linux.GNU 
Eg.: cd $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/
     ln -s platform_linux.GNU platform_macros.GNU

cd $ACE_ROOT/ace
make

cd ..
ln -s ace/libACE.so
ln -s ace/libACE.so.5.4.4

Remark: Newer versions of ace come with a (experimental) configure file, for example ACE 5.4.7.
This makes things easier. 


Messagelib make:
================

Update the ACEROOT variable in the makefile to point
to the ACE_ROOT of your installation. If you don't know what
this means try installing ACE first, it will all become clear.

Make sure you have the compilerflag -DACE_LACKS_SYSLOG_H, otherwise
ACE will include syslog.h and this will clash with OcfaLog::syslog_event_types.

Furthermore, don't use pedantic-errors because the messagelib currently
generates loads of warnings, and thus will fail to compile if you use
this flag.
