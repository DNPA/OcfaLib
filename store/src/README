The store still needs a Makefile. However, you sould be able to build some tests
from the command line.

I assume that ocfamisc is located in /usr/lib/ocfa0.5 which you should have after
'make install' in some of the higher directories.

Small script to build some of the files.

#!/bin/bash

cd /home/oscar/OcfaLib/store/src/
g++ -rdynamic AbstractRepository.cpp SimpleRepository.cpp EvidenceStoreEntity.cpp StoreEntity.cpp MsgStoreEntity.cpp MetaStoreEntity.cpp testStore.cpp -I../inc -I../../inc -L/usr/lib/ocfa0.5 -locfamisc -liconv -o SimpleRepository


To build de shared objects use;

g++ -shared PgRepository.cpp -I../inc -I../../inc -lpq -o PgRepository.so
